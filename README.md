# COMP90015 Assignment 1: Java Socket Implementation with Worker-Pool Architecture

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of Assignment 1 for COMP90015 (Distributed Systems) at the University of Melbourne. It showcases a Java application using socket programming for both server and client sides, incorporating a worker-pool architecture to handle concurrent requests. The project also features Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) on both the server and client sides.

Key highlights of this project:
- **Full Marks on Implementation**: Achieved a full score in the basic components (10/10 for application and report)
- **Excellent**:Attained marks(3/3) for the excellence component by handling edge cases and performing high concurrency tests with JMeter.
- **Creativity**: Attained marks (2/2) for the creativity component by implementing a custom thread pool that ensures thread safety without relying on built-in methods.
- **GUI Integration**: Includes intuitive GUIs for both server and client components.

## File Structure

- `DictionaryApplication`: The source Eclipse workspace containing the Java code.
- `additionalSDLC`: Includes external JAR files for JSON handling and SQLite integration.
- `provingImage`: Contains images used in the project report.
- `Dictionary.db`: A SQLite database file. Note: If the database does not exist when the server JAR file is run, the application will automatically create it.

## Acknowledgements
